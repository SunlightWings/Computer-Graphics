# Overview:

    -PLY format stores graphical objects as collections of polygons.
    -It supports ASCII and binary sub-formats.
    -Elements include vertices, faces, and user-defined elements.
    -Properties, like color and normal direction, are attached to elements.

# Structure:

    -Header: Describes format, elements, and properties.
    -Elements: Vertices and faces are primary; custom elements can be defined.
    -Properties: Scalar and list data types; define attributes for elements.

# Writing PLY Files:

    -Define format version and element types in the header.
    -Specify properties for each element, including data type and order.
    -List vertices and faces in the file.

# Reading PLY Files:

    -Softwares like MeshLab can read PLY files directly.
    -Interpret header to understand format, elements, and properties.
    -Process vertex and face data according to header specifications.
