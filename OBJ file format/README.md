        PLY: More flexible, supports custom elements.
    2. Data Representation:
        OBJ: Separate specifications for vertices, texture mappings, and normals.
        PLY: Uses properties for structured data representation.
    3. Compatibility:
        OBJ: Widely supported.
        PLY: Suitable for complex applications.
    4. Ease of Use:
        OBJ: Beginner-friendly.
        PLY: Requires understanding of element types and properties.
